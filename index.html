<small>TEST TEST Here are 10 things I thought were worth sharing this week: 

My friend Jason Polan died. I wrote about his art and what he meant to me.
 
I loved Sam Anderson’s Boom Town: The Fantastical Saga of Oklahoma City, Its Chaotic Founding, Its Apocalyptic Weather, Its Purloined Basketball Team, and the Dream of Becoming a World-class Metropolis. The book is as crazy and long as its subtitle. 
 
How to turn your books into time capsules.
 
How Kobe Bryant stole like an artist.
 
How to picture history.
 
Ear candy: it’s the 20th anniversary of D’Angelo’s Voodoo. (A perfect album, but I think I love Black Messiah even more? They’re both incredible.)
 
Podcast: I enjoyed this Fresh Air that excerpted a 1990 interview with Ram Dass and an interview with religion scholar Elaine Pagels in which she talked about belief vs. practice. (One of my favorite topics.)
 
Parents: Check out these $5000 grants for writers and artists with children.
 
Some news that made this library lover smile: Last year Americans went to the library more than they went to the movies.
 
Tomorrow is February. It’s a leap year, so why not try a 29-day challenge?
Thanks for reading. Do me a favor this week and reach out to someone you love and tell them you love them. Life is short. You never know when you’ll get another chance.
